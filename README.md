Find First Common Element Index

Problem Description
You are given two vectors a and b. Find the first index i where a[i] == b[i].

If a is empty, return 0. If b is empty, return the length of a.

If there is no i such that a[i] == b[i], return the length of a.

Hint: if a and b are not the same length, you should loop from 0..shorter.
